## Addition and Multiplication GRPC Example

## In this program we build a basic calculator API by implementing gRPC protobufs.

## Usage -> To run, go to the /server folder and type `go run main.go`, then open another terminal and go to the client directory and run `go build main.go`.
## To build an executable file run `go build main.go` on each of these directories (server and client).
